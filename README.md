# NetflixClone

## This is a code example created by me and my friends to study some concepts, such as:

### - TMDB API Rest
### - UIKit
### - Collection Views
### - Special Cells in TableViews
### - Passing data between screens with segues

## In this project we decided to code some screens of the App Netflix, our Design System can be seen here: https://www.figma.com/file/4rzybgnEruyLwtjApiTLzw/TuDuum!!?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=EuXORQcdWiRIf8oB-0
